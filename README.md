# UninformedSearch Introduction. 
implementation of brute force methods for searching in AI>
I have implemented both the DFS and BFS using the same format and structure the only difference is the the DFS uses a **StackFrontier** while the BFS uses a **QueueFrontier**. The search is demostrated through a **weighted directed graph** problem. 

## Depth First Search (DFS):
Aims to find the path by exploring a route to its extreme then turns back if it reaches a dead end. I have implemented it using a List datastructure in python since it is based on the **First In First out** Principle.


## Breath First Search(BFS):
Aims to find the a solution from the initial state to the goal state using the **Last in First Out** principle.
